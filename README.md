1. Capsule Detection system this system to detect the capsule by camera in the production
line at high speed machine and reject the defect product. 

2. NTRM Detection system this system to detect the foreign particles in the production line at highspeed machine and reject the defect product.

3. Robot Installation CFC has been placed by the man power on pallet as on CFC weight is around 40Kgs
after installation of this robot 2 lines is handled by one robot. 

4. Stamping unit and Track and trace unit this unit is installed as per government and market requirement by this production can be detected by unique ID. 

5. PCT curve wander detection this is taken as trail projects for detection of curve graphics as
existing system is not capable of it and configuration of camera along with vendor. 

6. Waste sorting
machine Man power required for sorting of waste in production now it has been eliminated. 

7. Case packer taping unit by this unit the taping process as been motorized for good taping quality before it
was cylinder-based
