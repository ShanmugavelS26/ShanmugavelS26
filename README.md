 2. Installed the robot and trained by the vendors to hand on the robot and maintain in working at production time and **ordered the required spares at interval of 3 months** and Operation training given to machine crew
 3. **40 points closed** after installation issue faced at robot

â€¢ **Stamping unit and Track and trace unit** 
 1. This unit is **installed as per government and market requirement** by this products can be detected by unique ID.
 2. **Installation on stamping unit and track and trace unit on given deadline** took into production and configuration of camera and setting as per products

â€¢ **PCT curve wander detection**
 1. This is taken as **trail projects for detection of curve graphics as existing system** is not capable of it and configuration of camera along with vendor.

â€¢ **Waste sorting machine**
 1. **Man power required for sorting of waste** in production now it has been eliminated.
 2. Installation of waste sorting machine as per **safety guideline converted 230V control unit to 24 V control unit** and addition motors added at machine competed on before deadlines

â€¢ **Case packer taping unit**
 1. By this unit the **taping process as been motorized** for good taping quality **before it was cylinder-based**
 2. Installing of tapping unit connection and mounting of motor and **logic modification in PLC** end

â€¢ **Case packer Outer miss detection camera** 
 1. This system is to **detect the missed outer across all rows and columns** before only top layer was getting detected by camera based
 2. Installing the camera calculated the distance of the product and choosing the correct camera and configuration of it to detect the miss outer, **logic modified in PLC and in HMI message edit**

â€¢ **Case packer conveyor extension** 
 1. New conveyor added and extension done for **creating more buffer for producing CFC**
 2. Conveyor extension Control unit connection done motor fixed and new gates and sensor added and **took it into existing logic** and finished it before deadline
